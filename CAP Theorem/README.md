### What is a Distributed System?
A distributed system is a network that stores data on more than one node (physical or virtual machines) at the same time. Another way to state that, a distributed system is a collection of independent computers (or nodes) that work together as a single system to achieve a common goal. These computers communicate and coordinate with each other over a network. It is essential to understand the CAP theorem when designing a app so that we can choose a data management system that delivers the characteristics our application needs most.

### What is the CAP Theorem?
The CAP theorem is a fundamental principle of distributed systems. It postulates the three potential system attributesâ€” Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance, but a distributed system cannot guarantee all three attributes simultaneously at the same time.
